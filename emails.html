                This channel was created on <strong>December 20th, 2016</strong> by Alexander.
                The first video was titled <strong>"Penguin Magic"</strong> and was published on
                <strong>February 17th, 2017</strong>. From then until June 22nd, 2022, content
                was uploaded somewhat regularly, mostly consisting of Alex and occasionally his dad,

                For a period of about 2 years, almost no content was posted until <strong>May 31st, 2024</strong>.
                This was a pivotal moment for I Think I'm a Nerd — it both revived the channel and introduced
                <strong>Milo</strong>, who became a regular contributor.

            <p>
                Milo and Alex have been friends since early elementary school. During a school trip in May 2024,
                while staying in a hotel, they decided to film multiple YouTube Shorts. In just two days,
                they recorded and published <strong>15 Shorts</strong>. Since then, the channel has continued
                posting both short and long-form content regularly.
